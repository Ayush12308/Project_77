    <p id="about_vs">Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, 
        task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for 
        a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.
